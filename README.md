## üíª Usage

When you use Upptime, we automatically add the required workflows. If you want to manually use this package, you can use `npx`:

Generate the `README.md` summary file:

```bash
npx @upptime/uptime-monitor summary
```

Make network requests to get the response time and commit them to git history:

```bash
npx @upptime/uptime-monitor response-time
```

Generate the static status website, powered by [upptime/status-page](https://github.com/upptime/status-page):

```bash
npx @upptime/uptime-monitor site
```

Generate response time graphs, powered by [upptime/graphs](https://github.com/upptime/graphs):

```bash
npx @upptime/uptime-monitor graphs
```

Check uptime, but don't make git commits with network requests:

```bash
npx @upptime/uptime-monitor
```
